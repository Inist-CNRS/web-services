post.requestBody.content.application/json.example.0.value: Introduction  In  bibliographic  databases,  affiliations  of  authors  are  of  paramount  importance.  Hence,  they  permit  to  the  laboratories  or  institutes  to  get  national  and  even  international  visibility,  as  well  as  they  consequently  provide  authors  with  scientiﬁc  caution. We  cannot discuss the  issue  of affiliations  without talking of ”Shanghai  ranking”  which  aims  at  evaluating  universities.  Our  purpose  here  is  not  to  feed  up  the  controversy  (Van  Raan  2005)  (Liu,  Cheng and Liu 2005), but to point out that the  management of affiliation plays an important role in the calculation  of universities ”performance”. Moed (Moed 2005) reports some problems with author’s names and also institutions:  ”Authors  from  the  same  institution,  or  even  from  the  same  department,  may  not  indicate  their  institutional  affiliations  in  the  same  way”.  Depending  on  the  country,  it  is  not  always  clear  how  to  name  a  laboratory  with  respect to its supervisory authorities. The affiliation is also important information to disambiguate author names in  bibliographic  databases.  In  this  context,  Wang  points  out  that:  “as  the  amount  of  available  information  increases,  problem caused by misspelling, spelling difference, and name or affiliation change also become worse.” (Wang and  al.  2012).  A  standardization  of  data  in  bibliographic  databases  is  thus  necessary  to  carry  out  informetrics  studies,  but  it  is  not  a  trivial  task:  the  practice,  whatever  it  is  intentional  or  not,  of  omitting  institutional  affiliations,  or  giving incomplete or wrong information is not uncommon (Hood and Wilson 2003). Each  year,  the  CNRS  (the  French  National  Center  of  Scientific  Research)  has  to  spot  its  laboratories  affiliations  among the French ones. Many of them are easy to identify automatically thank to key words extraction but, at the  issue of this process, it still remains  unidentified  affiliations (fig. 1). New  methods for disambiguation could  help  the information analysts to be more efficient when labeling. This paper proposes an approach based on Bayes learning method and overlapping clustering. It is structured  as  follows:  section  2  summarizes  related  works  and  identiﬁes  problems.  Section  3  describes  our  approach  ﬁrstly  with  supervised  learning  method  and  then  with  semi-supervised  method.  Next,  section  4  reports  experiments  and  results. Section 5 concludes and discusses future work.  State of the art and discussion  As part of bibliometric analyzes, the authors a liations can produce statistics by laboratories as well as by institutes  or universities. However, such analyses often face with problems of high variability and heterogeneity of naming: a  single  laboratory  name  may  thus  appear  in  several  di erent  ways  if  the  authors  use  di erent  abbreviations,  incomplete or misspelled words (typing mistakes, spelling...). In addition, some universities can have several names  (for  example  University  Pierre  and  Marie  Curie  =  University  Paris  VI).  This  problem  is  known  for  long  but  still  persists nowadays. In the 1990s, De Bruin et al. (De Bruin and Moed 1990) point out the problem of variability of  the  author  addresses  in  databases  such  as  SCI  (Science  Citation  Index).  They  highlight  the  case  of  countries  like  Germany  or  France  where  the  heterogeneity  of  data  is  particularly  important.  Zitt  (Zitt  and  Bassecoulard  2008)  emphasizes  the  importance  of  data  standardization  (author  names,  a liations)  with  special  consideration  to  countries  like  France  where  a liations  overlap  is  important  (for  example  one  laboratory  can  have  a  University  a liation and a CNRS a liation). For many bibliometrics analysis, the uniﬁcation of institutional ad-dresses is an  essential task to be carried out prior to any study ((Bourke and Butler 1996), (Osareh and Wilson 2000)). For  solving  the  problem,  De  Bruin  (De  Bruin  and  Moed  1990)  propose  to  deal  separately  with  all  the  words  belonging to a liations and to use in a second step a classiﬁcation strategy to unify all possible variations of the  di erent  words.  In  a  later  work  (De  Bruin  and  Moed  1993),  the  same  authors  use  a  ”single-link  clustering”  approach  to  delineate  di erent  areas  of  science  on  the  basis  of  ...
