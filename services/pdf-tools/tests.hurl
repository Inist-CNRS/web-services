Searches were not restricted by trial status or\nlanguage. Additional trials were identified through contact with experts.\nSTUDY SELECTION Eligible trials randomly assigned patients hospitalized for COVID-19 to\n\na group in whom IL-6 antagonists were administered and to a group in whom neither IL-6\nantagonists nor any other immunomodulators except corticosteroids were administered.\nAmong 72 potentially eligible trials, 27 (37.5%) met study selection criteria.\nDATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS In this prospective meta-analysis, risk of bias was assessed\nusing the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Inconsistency among trial results was\nassessed using the I2 statistic. The primary analysis was an inverse variance–weighted\nfixed-effects meta-analysis of odds ratios (ORs) for 28-day all-cause mortality.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality at 28\ndays after randomization. There were 9 secondary outcomes including progression to\ninvasive mechanical ventilation or death and risk of secondary infection by 28 days.\nRESULTS A total of 10 930 patients (median age, 61 years [range of medians, 52-68 years];\n3560 [33%] were women) participating in 27 trials were included. By 28 days, there were\n1407 deaths among 6449 patients randomized to IL-6 antagonists and 1158 deaths among\n4481 patients randomized to usual care or placebo (summary OR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.79-0.95];\nP = .003 based on a fixed-effects meta-analysis). This corresponds to an absolute mortality\nrisk of 22% for IL-6 antagonists compared with an assumed mortality risk of 25% for usual\ncare or placebo. The corresponding summary ORs were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.74-0.92; P < .001)\nfor tocilizumab and 1.08 (95% CI, 0.86-1.36; P = .52) for sarilumab. The summary ORs for the\nassociation with mortality compared with usual care or placebo in those receiving\ncorticosteroids were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.68-0.87) for tocilizumab and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.61-1.38)\nfor sarilumab. The ORs for the association with progression to invasive mechanical ventilation\nor death, compared with usual care or placebo, were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.70-0.85) for all IL-6\nantagonists, 0.74 (95% CI, 0.66-0.82) for tocilizumab, and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.74-1.34) for\nsarilumab. Secondary infections by 28 days occurred in 21.9% of patients treated with IL-6\nantagonists vs 17.6% of patients treated with usual care or placebo (OR accounting for trial\nsample sizes, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.85-1.16).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this prospective meta-analysis of clinical trials of patients\nhospitalized for COVID-19, administration of IL-6 antagonists, compared with usual care or\nplacebo, was associated with lower 28-day all-cause mortality.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION PROSPERO Identifier: CRD42021230155\n\nGroup Information: The WHO Rapid\nEvidence Appraisal for COVID-19\nTherapies (REACT) Working Group\nauthors and collaborators are listed at\nthe end of this article.\nCorresponding Author: Manu\nShankar-Hari, MSc, PhD,\nSt Thomas’ Hospital, Guy’s\nand St Thomas’ NHS Foundation\nTrust London, East Wing, London\nSE17EH, England (manu.shankar-hari\n@kcl.ac.uk).\n\nJAMA. doi:10.1001/jama.2021.11330\nPublished online July 6, 2021.\n\n(Reprinted) E1\n\n© 2021 American Medical Association.

The IL-6 antagonists\ncommonly investigated were monoclonal antibodies that bind\neither to membrane-bound and soluble IL-6 receptors (eg, tocilizumab and sarilumab) or directly to IL-6 (eg, siltuximab).5\nTo address the need for reliable efficacy data to guide clinical management, the World Health Organization (WHO) Rapid\nEvidence Appraisal for COVID-19 Therapies (REACT) Working Group developed a prospective meta-analysis protocol to\nperform a prospective meta-analysis of IL-6 antagonists in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. This approach was recently\nused6 to evaluate the use of corticosteroids in patients with\nCOVID-19.7 During this initiative, trials variously reported potential clinical benefit,8-10 no benefit,11-13 and potential harm14\nwith IL-6 antagonists in patients hospitalized for COVID-19.\nThe primary objective of this prospective meta-analysis of\nrandomized trials6 was to estimate the association between administration of IL-6 antagonists, compared with usual care or\nplacebo, and mortality at 28 days after randomization in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. The secondary objectives were\nto estimate associations within subgroups relating to disease\nseverity (eg, level of respiratory support), treatments at randomization (eg, receipt of corticosteroids), patient characteristics (eg, age), and risk of bias15 overall and separately for tocilizumab and sarilumab.\n\nMethods\nIdentification and Eligibility of Trials\nTrials were identified through systematic searches of\nClinicalTrials.gov, the EU Clinical Trials Register, and the WHO\nInternational Clinical Trials Registry Platform from October 7,\n2020, to January 11, 2021. The search terms used were random* AND COVID in the title or abstract, along with terms for\ncommon IL-6 antagonists individually (tocilizumab, sarilumab, clazakizumab, siltuximab, olokizumab) and the term interleukin 6. Individual searches were then combined. Searches\nwere not restricted by trial status (ongoing or completed), publication status, or language. Additional trials were identified\nthrough contact with experts from the REACT Working Group.\nQueries regarding eligibility for inclusion were resolved by consensus. Eligible trials randomly assigned patients hospitalized for COVID-19 to IL-6 antagonists vs usual care or placebo. Trials in which anti–IL-6 therapies were combined with\nother immunomodulatory agents or with active comparators\nother than systemic corticosteroids were excluded.\n\nDevelopment of Prospective Meta-analysis Protocol\nThe WHO chief scientist invited investigators of eligible trials\nto participate in this prospective meta-analysis. Representative investigators and sponsors of potentially eligible trials were\nasked to participate in weekly development calls for the prospective meta-analysis protocol starting on November 23, 2020.\nE2\n\nKey Points\nQuestion Is administration of IL-6 antagonists associated with\n28-day all-cause mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19?\nFindings This prospective meta-analysis of 27 randomized trials\nincluded 10 930 patients, of whom 2565 died by 28 days. The\n28-day all-cause mortality was lower among patients who received\nIL-6 antagonists compared with those who received usual care or\nplacebo (summary odds ratio, 0.86). The summary odds ratios for\nthe association of IL-6 antagonist treatment with 28-day all-cause\nmortality were 0.78 with concomitant administration of\ncorticosteroids vs 1.09 without administration of corticosteroids.\nMeaning Administration of IL-6 antagonists, compared with usual\ncare or placebo, was associated with lower 28-day all-cause\nmortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19.\n\nThe prospective meta-analysis protocol was registered on the\nPROSPERO database on January 14, 2021, and regularly updated. The PICO (patient problem or population, intervention, comparison or control, and outcome) framework, definitions of outcomes, and subgroups of interest were agreed\nupon prior to collection of outcome data.6 The final version\nof the prospective meta-analysis protocol was registered before analyses started on March 29, 2021.\nTrial-level aggregate data sharing agreements were established. All trials had secured institutional review board approval, but approval was not required for secondary analyses. Informed consent for participation in each trial was\nobtained, consistent with local institutional review board requirements. Trial investigators were asked to complete baseline and outcome data collection forms that were subsequently verified by trial teams. Finalized data sets from\ncontributing trials were received by May 11, 2021.\n\nOutcomes and Comparisons\nThe primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality at 28\ndays after randomization. Two comparisons were specified a\npriori. The primary comparison investigated the class effect\nof IL-6 antagonists vs usual care or placebo and tocilizumab\nand sarilumab were examined separately. The second comparison was of IL-6 antagonists vs corticosteroids.\nThe secondary outcomes included: (1) invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation\n(ECMO), or death by 28 days in patients not receiving IMV\nat randomization (this is the most important secondary\noutcome for which data on all subgroups were collected);\n(2) cardiovascular system support (defined as receipt of vasopressors) or death by 28 days in patients not receiving cardiovascular system support at randomization; (3) secondary\ninfections by 28 days (this is the most important safety outcome); (4) in-hospital mortality; (5) kidney replacement\ntherapy (KRT) or death by 28 days in patients not receiving\nKRT at randomization (excluding patients with underlying\ndialysis dependence or ≥stage III chronic kidney disease);\n(6) discharged alive from the hospital by 28 days; (7) mortality by 90 days; (8) duration of IMV up to 28 days (in those\nreceiving IMV at randomization, with duration coded as 28\n\nJAMA Published online July 6, 2021 (Reprinted)\n\n© 2021 American Medical Association.

Data on serious adverse events or serious adverse\nreactions (as defined in each trial) were collected; however,\nno meta-analysis was planned because diverse definitions\nwere used by different trials.\n\nSubgroup Analyses\nTrial investigators supplied summary data for all outcomes\naccording to intervention group, overall, and in subgroups\nbased on: (1) degree of respiratory support at randomization\n(patient not receiving supplemental oxygen therapy, patient\nreceiving supplemental oxygen therapy [defined as oxygen\nflow rate ≤15 L/min by face mask or nasal cannula], patient\nreceiving noninvasive ventilation [defined as oxygen flow\nrate >15 L/min, high-flow nasal cannula, continuous positive\nairway pressure], or patient receiving IMV or ECMO) and\n(2) receipt of systemic corticosteroids at randomization. In\naddition, the following subgroups were used for the outcomes of 28-day all-cause mortality and progression to IMV\nor death: (1) patients receiving acute organ support therapy at\nrandomization (vasopressors or KRT) among those receiving\nnoninvasive ventilation, IMV, or ECMO; (2) age (<70 years or\n≥70 years); (3) sex (female or male); (4) race/ethnicity\n(collected by investigators in each individual trial); and\n(5) C-reactive protein level at baseline (categorized as <75,\n75-<150, ≥150 μg/mL). The assigned dose of IL-6 antagonists\nwas classified as low (4 mg/kg of tocilizumab; 200 mg of sarilumab) or high (>4 mg/kg of tocilizumab or multiple doses;\n>400 mg of sarilumab or multiple doses).\n\nRisk of Bias Assessment\nFor each trial, the risk of bias (low risk, some concerns, or high\nrisk) was assessed using version 2 of the Cochrane Risk of Bias\nAssessment Tool.15 Risk of bias assessments were based on the\ntrial protocols and flowcharts following the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials together with information supplied\nby the investigators for each trial in a standard format. Risk of\nbias assessments were done independently by 3 of the investigators (J.P.T.H., F.S., J.S.) with disagreements resolved through\ndiscussion. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the certainty of the evidence.\n\nOriginal Investigation Research\n\nciations also were estimated using random-effects metaanalyses with a restricted maximum likelihood estimate of\nheterogeneity 16 and Hartung-Knapp adjustment 17,18 to\naccount for uncertainty in the estimation of between-study\nvariance. To obtain illustrative absolute risk estimates for\npatients not receiving treatment with IL-6 antagonists, a\nmortality risk of 25% and a progression risk of 33% to IMV or\ndeath were assumed (the approximate risks among all eligible patients allocated to usual care or placebo). Metaanalytic ORs were then applied to obtain the corresponding\nrisk with IL-6 antagonists. Because outcome data were generally complete or nearly complete across trials, we restricted\nthe analyses to trial participants with outcomes recorded.\nDifferences in associations between the subgroups were\nquantified by calculating ratios of ORs (or analogous statistics for other outcome types) to compare the effects in the subgroups along with corresponding P values for interaction. If\nthe ratio of ORs was equal to 1, the estimated associations in\nthe 2 subgroups were the same. The further the ratio of ORs\nwas from 1, the greater was the difference between the estimated associations in the 2 subgroups. Comparisons between subgroups defined by trial characteristics were made\nusing random-effects meta-regression and appropriately accounted for common controls19 in trials with 3 treatment\ngroups. Comparisons between subgroups defined by patient\ncharacteristics were done by estimating trial-specific ratios of\nORs comparing associations between subgroups and then combining these in meta-analyses.20 The ORs in patients not receiving corticosteroids were compared with patients receiving corticosteroids at randomization within the respiratory\nsupport subgroups. Subgroup-specific estimates adjusted to\ncorrespond with the ratios of ORs that were derived from the\nwithin-trial approach were also estimated.\nIn the sensitivity analyses, associations were estimated that\n(1) excluded the Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy\n(RECOVERY) trial; (2) restricted the analyses to trial results at\nlow risk of bias; (3) restricted the analyses to trials published\nin peer-reviewed journals; (4) restricted the analyses to placebo-controlled trials; and (5) restricted the analyses to openlabel trials. The first and third of these were post hoc sensitivity analyses. All analyses were conducted using Stata version\n16 (StataCorp) and new Stata commands to conduct and graph\nthe results of the meta-analyses.21,22\n\nData Analyses\nThe primary analysis was an inverse variance–weighted\nfixed-effects meta-analysis of odds ratios (ORs). For the duration of IMV therapy, investigators supplied the mean difference and associated 95% CIs in days comparing the treatment\nand control groups. For the 90-day outcomes, the trial investigators were asked to estimate hazard ratios and 95% CIs (or\nlog hazard ratios and associated standard errors) using Cox\nregression. Inconsistency in associations among the trials\nwas quantified using the I2 statistic. P values for heterogeneity were derived using the Cochran Q statistic. Precise\nP values were reported; however, the prospective metaanalysis protocol specified that a threshold for statistical significance would not be used. As a sensitivity analysis for the\nprimary outcome of 28-day all-cause mortality, overall assojama.com\n\nResults\nA total of 72 potentially eligible trials were identified. After\nscreening these trials, 38 ineligible trials, 3 duplicated records,\nand 2 trials directly comparing IL-6 antagonists with corticosteroids (NCT04329650 [n = 158 patients] and NCT04345445\n[n = 59 patients]) were excluded. Of 29 eligible trials that\nrandomized patients to receive IL-6 antagonists vs usual care\nor placebo, 1 trial (n = 50 patients) was unable to supply data in\na timely manner and 1 trial (n = 295 patients) was still following\nup patients for the primary outcome.\nAmong the 27 trials included in the meta-analyses, 9 were\npublished8-14,23,24 and the remaining 18 were unpublished or\n(Reprinted) JAMA Published online July 6, 2021\n\n© 2021 American Medical Association.

Outcome data were supplied for\n10 930 patients, representing 95.4% of all patients randomized\nin eligible trials (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1). Patients were\nrecruited from 28 countries from February 26, 2020.\nThe IL-6 antagonists assessed were tocilizumab (19 trials\nallocating 4299 patients to tocilizumab and 3749 patients to\nusual care or placebo), sarilumab (9 trials allocating 2073\npatients to sarilumab and 753 patients to usual care or placebo), and siltuximab (1 trial allocating 77 patients to siltuximab and 72 patients to usual care or placebo). The Randomized, Embedded, Multifactorial Adaptive Platform Trial for\nCommunity-Acquired Pneumonia 8 (REMAP-CAP) and\nCOV-AID (NCT04330638) trials randomized patients to more\nthan 1 IL-6 antagonist. Due to limited data (including outcome\nevents), associations for siltuximab within predefined\nsubgroups were not estimated. Similarly, due to limited data,\nassociations were not estimated in the predefined low-dose\nstrata (2 trials for tocilizumab [27 patients] and in 2 trials for\nsarilumab [307 patients]), in the no oxygen respiratory support subgroup (27 patients and 4 deaths in 3 trials), and for\ntrials reporting secondary infections at 90 days. Because of\nthe diversity of classification of race/ethnicity among different\ntrials, the subgroup analyses according to race/ethnicity are\nnot reported. Because not all trials estimated hazard ratios for\n90-day mortality, the event numbers were also analyzed to\nestimate the ORs.\nThe median age across the trials was 61 years (range of medians, 52-68 years) and 3560 patients (33%) were women. Concurrent treatments at randomization varied substantially\namong the trials. Most patients received respiratory support\nat randomization. A greater proportion of patients in the sarilumab trials received IMV (31% [873/3136 patients]) compared with patients in the tocilizumab trials (15% [1211/8134\npatients]) and a smaller proportion received corticosteroids\n(35% [890/3136 patients] vs 66% [5317/8134 patients], respectively; Table 1). The primary outcome was missing for 183 patients (1.6%). Three trials recorded no deaths by 28 days\n(COVID-19: Salvage Tocilizumab as a Rescue Measure [COVIDSTORM {NCT04577534}; n = 39]; Efficacy of Tocilizumab in\nModifying the Inflammatory Parameters of Patients With\nCOVID-19 [COVITOZ-01 {NCT04435717}; n = 26]; and Clinical\nTrial of the Use of Tocilizumab for Treatment of SARS-CoV-2\nInfection [COVID-19; TOCOVID] {NCT04332094} [n = 270]).\nRisk of bias was assessed to be low in 22 of the trials contributing to the meta-analysis of 28-day all-cause mortality,\ncomprising 78% of the weight in the analysis. Six trials were\njudged to have some concerns, mainly due to small numbers\nof patients being excluded from the data set because they did\nnot receive their assigned intervention. In 1 trial judged as high\nrisk, comprising 0.65% of the weight, the usual procedures\nE4\n\nwere not in place to ensure that the allocation sequence was\nconcealed; however, there was no reason to suspect that the\nconcealed allocation was not implemented as intended. Risk\nof bias assessments were similar for progression to IMV or\ndeath. For secondary infections, results from open-label trials\nwere judged to have some concerns over bias in determining\nwhether such infections had occurred due to the subjective nature of the decision (eFigure 2 and eTable 4 in Supplement 1).\n\nAssociation Between IL-6 Antagonists\nand 28-Day All-Cause Mortality\nBy 28 days after randomization, there were 1407 deaths among\n6449 patients randomized to IL-6 antagonists and 1158 deaths\namong 4481 patients randomized to usual care or placebo.\nUsing a fixed-effects meta-analysis, the summary OR was 0.86\n(95% CI, 0.79-0.95; P = .003). This corresponds to an absolute mortality risk of 22% for IL-6 antagonists compared with\nan assumed mortality risk of 25% for usual care or placebo. The\nsummary OR was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.76-1.05; P = .16) in a sensitivity analysis using random-effects meta-analysis (eFigure 3\nin Supplement 1). The certainty in this result was assessed to\nbe high in the GRADE assessment.\nIn 19 trials that randomized 4299 patients to tocilizumab\n(960 deaths) and 3749 patients to usual care or placebo (1023\ndeaths), the summary OR was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.74-0.92;\nP < .001). This corresponds to an absolute mortality risk of 22%\nfor tocilizumab compared with an assumed mortality risk of\n25% for usual care or placebo. In 9 trials that randomized 2073\npatients to sarilumab (473 deaths) and 753 patients to usual care\nor placebo (139 deaths), the summary OR was 1.08 (95% CI,\n0.86-1.36; P = .52). This corresponds to an absolute mortality\nrisk of 26% for sarilumab compared with an assumed mortality risk of 25% for usual care or placebo. There was little inconsistency between the trial results (I2 = 18% overall, I2 = 3%\nfor tocilizumab, and I2 = 0% for sarilumab). The inverse association with 28-day all-cause mortality appeared more marked\nfor tocilizumab than for sarilumab (ratio of ORs, 0.76 [95% CI,\n0.59-0.98], P = .04 for interaction; Figure 1 and Table 2).\nData on receipt of corticosteroids at randomization were\navailable in 22 trials (9953 patients and 2495 deaths). The\nsummary ORs for 28-day all-cause mortality comparing IL-6\nantagonists with usual care or placebo were 1.09 (95% CI,\n0.91-1.30) for 3637 patients (830 deaths) not receiving corticosteroids and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.69-0.88) for 6316 patients\n(1665 deaths) receiving corticosteroids (Figure 2). The corresponding absolute mortality risk in patients receiving corticosteroids was 21% for IL-6 antagonists compared with an\nassumed mortality risk of 25% for usual care or placebo.\nBased on within-trial estimates combined across 17 trials that\nincluded patients receiving and not receiving corticosteroids,\nthe inverse association between IL-6 antagonists and mortality was more marked in patients receiving corticosteroids (ratio of ORs, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.56-0.92]; P = .008 for interaction).\nThe summary OR for the association with mortality for tocilizumab (15 trials, 7490 patients, and 1951 deaths) was 1.06\n(95% CI, 0.85-1.33) in patients not receiving corticosteroids at\nrandomization and was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.68-0.87) in patients\nreceiving corticosteroids at randomization.

The summary ratio of ORs (based on\nwithin-trial comparisons) was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.44-1.33; P = .34\nfor interaction). The corresponding absolute mortality risks\nin patients receiving corticosteroids were 20% for tocilizumab and 23% for sarilumab compared with an assumed\nmortality risk of 25% for usual care or placebo. In additional\nanalyses, associations were compared in patients not receiving and receiving corticosteroids at randomization within the\nrespiratory support subgroups. The tendency for more\nmarked inverse associations among patients receiving corticosteroids appeared broadly consistent across respiratory\nsupport subgroups; however, the associations were not estimated precisely.\nDetailed results, forest plots, and comparisons between subgroups for 28-day all-cause mortality appear in Supplements 1\nand 2.

Most of the data (87%)\nwere from trials assessing tocilizumab. The summary ORs compared with usual care or placebo were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.700.85; P < .001) for all IL-6 antagonists, 0.74 (95% CI, 0.660.82) for tocilizumab, and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.74-1.35) for sarilumab\nE12\n\ntrial.\nc\n\nThe data for the PreToVid trial are based on events up until 30 days after\nrandomization.\n\nd\n\nThere were 21 patients in the control group for both treatment comparisons.\nThe analyses have been adjusted to correct for this.\n\n(Figure 3). The corresponding absolute risks of progression to\nIMV or death were 28% for all IL-6 antagonists, 27% for tocilizumab, and 33% for sarilumab compared with an assumed risk\nof 33% for usual care or placebo. There was little inconsistency between the trial results (I 2 = 0% for each metaanalysis). The certainty in the overall result was assessed to\nbe high in the GRADE assessment.

The ratio of ORs comparing the associations in those\nreceiving and not receiving corticosteroids was 0.78 (95% CI,\n0.59-1.02; P = .07 for interaction based on within-trial estimates combined across trials). The corresponding summary\nORs for tocilizumab (17 trials, 6608 patients, and 2104 progressed) were 0.95 (95% CI, 0.76-1.20) and 0.69 (95% CI, 0.610.78), respectively, and the corresponding ratio of ORs was 0.70\n(95% CI, 0.52-0.94; P = .02 for interaction). The corresponding summary ORs for sarilumab (7 trials, 1362 patients, and 298\nprogressed) were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.67-1.44) and 1.08 (95% CI,\n0.67-1.75), respectively, and the corresponding ratio of ORs was\n1.41 (95% CI, 0.65-3.07; P = .38 for interaction). The corresponding absolute risks for progression to IMV or death in patients receiving corticosteroids were 25% for tocilizumab and\n35% for sarilumab compared with an assumed risk of 33% for\nprogression to IMV or death for usual care or placebo.\nThe summary ORs for progression to IMV or death comparing IL-6 antagonists with usual care or placebo were 0.75\n(95% CI, 0.64-0.89) in 4044 patients (758 progressed) receiving supplemental oxygen at randomization and 0.77 (95% CI,\n0.68-0.89) in 3765 patients (1661 progressed) receiving noninvasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula (P = .67 for differences between these associations; Table 2). The corresponding summary ORs for tocilizumab were 0.72 (95% CI, 0.600.86) and 0.74 (95% CI, 0.64-0.85), respectively (P = .92 for\ndifferences between subgroups) and the corresponding summary ORs for sarilumab were 0.96 (95% CI, 0.60-1.53) and 1.06\n(95% CI, 0.71-1.57), respectively (P = .31 for differences between subgroups). The corresponding absolute risks for progression to IMV or death were 27% for all IL-6 antagonists, 27%\nfor tocilizumab, and 33% for sarilumab compared with an assumed risk for progression to IMV or death of 33% for usual\ncare or placebo.\nThe associations between IL-6 antagonists and progression to IMV or death within other subgroups defined by patient characteristics at randomization appeared consistent across\nall other subgroups (all P values for comparisons between subgroups were greater than .28; Table 2 and Supplement 3).\n\nAssociation Between IL-6 Antagonists and Infections\nby 28 Days\nAmong the 22 trials that reported 28-day infection outcomes,\n750 events occurred among 3428 patients randomized to IL-6\nantagonists and 330 events occurred among 1787 patients randomized to usual care or placebo. The fixed-effect summary\nOR was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.85-1.16) and there was little inconsistency between the trial results (I2 = 0%, P = .49 for heterogeneity; Figure 3). The certainty in this result was assessed to be\nmoderate in the GRADE assessment due to minor concerns over\nrisk of bias (because of subjectivity in the outcome assessment) and minor concerns over imprecision (because of the\nresult being compatible with a slightly lower or higher risk\namong those receiving IL-6 antagonists). The ORs were 0.95\n(95% CI, 0.77-1.16) for tocilizumab and 1.03 (95% CI, 0.801.32) for sarilumab (Figure 4 and Table 2). The summary ORs\njama.com\n\nOriginal Investigation Research\n\nwithin subgroups were close to 1. Data on 28-day secondary\ninfections appear in Supplement 4.\n\nAssociation Between IL-6 Antagonists\nand Other Secondary Outcomes\nData on in-hospital mortality were available from 19 trials. The\nsummary ORs for in-hospital mortality comparing IL-6 antagonists with usual care or placebo were 0.80 (95% CI, 0.710.89) in 7261 patients (1848 deaths), with little inconsistency\nbetween trials (I2 = 0%) (Table 3). Most of the data (90.7%) were\nfrom 14 trials (6587 patients and 1741 deaths) assessing tocilizumab and the summary OR was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.71-0.90).\nAmong patients not requiring cardiovascular system support at randomization (15 trials), 344 of 1587 patients randomized to IL-6 antagonists and 343 of 1199 patients randomized to\nusual care or placebo progressed to requiring cardiovascular system support or death within 28 days. Most of the data (2553/\n2786 patients; 91.1%) were from 13 trials assessing tocilizumab. The summary ORs were 0.71 (95% CI, 0.59-0.86) for IL-6\nantagonists and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.57-0.85) for tocilizumab. Among\npatients not requiring KRT at randomization (13 trials), 935 of\n3653 patients randomized to IL-6 antagonists and 1069 of 3351\npatients randomized to usual care progressed to requiring KRT\nor died within 28 days. The summary OR was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.710.88); most of the data (6884/7004 patients; 98.2%) were from\n12 trials assessing tocilizumab.\nAmong 10 904 patients recruited to participate in 26 trials,\n6609 were discharged alive by 28 days. The summary OR comparing IL-6 antagonists with usual care or placebo was 1.22\n(95% CI, 1.12-1.33), favoring IL-6 antagonists. The corresponding ORs were 1.30 (95% CI, 1.18-1.43) for tocilizumab and 0.95\n(95% CI, 0.79-1.15) for sarilumab.\nData were available for all-cause mortality at 90 days in\n13 trials and at 60 days in 4 trials (1104 deaths among 4651 patients). Two trials reported no events. The summary OR comparing IL-6 antagonists with usual care or placebo was 0.89\n(95% CI, 0.76-1.04). The corresponding ORs were 0.85 (95%\nCI, 0.69-1.05) for tocilizumab and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.74-1.16) for\nsarilumab. Additional survival analyses for all-cause mortality at 90 days are reported in eTable 5 in Supplement 1.\nAmong 1171 patients who were receiving IMV at randomization and were recruited to 9 trials, the weighted mean difference comparing IL-6 antagonists with usual care or placebo in the duration of IMV was −0.84 (95% CI, −1.82 to 0.13),\nfavoring IL-6 antagonists. Most of the data were from 8 trials\nassessing tocilizumab (1101/1171 patients; 94.0%).\nTable 3 and Supplements 5-10 provide detailed analyses\ncomparing IL-6 antagonists with usual care or placebo overall and in predefined subgroups for all of the secondary outcomes. Although the associations appeared broadly consistent across subgroups, many were not estimated precisely.\n\nSerious Adverse Events or Reactions\nData describing serious adverse events were supplied by 23\ntrials. Risks of serious adverse events were broadly similar for\npatients randomized to IL-6 antagonists and to usual care or\nplacebo across all trials. Data on secondary infections at 90 days\nafter randomization were limited (11 trials and 310 events)\n(Reprinted) JAMA Published online July 6, 2021\n\n© 2021 American Medical Association.

After\nexcluding the large RECOVERY trial, the ORs comparing tocilizumab with usual care or placebo were 0.82 (95% CI, 0.680.98) for 28-day all-cause mortality and 0.71 (95% CI, 0.590.84) for progression to IMV or death within 28 days (consistent\nwith the primary analyses). The ORs for the trials at low risk of\nbias were similar to the overall ORs. The ORs restricted to trials\npublished in peer-reviewed journals were consistent with the\noverall ORs for tocilizumab but were imprecisely estimated for\nsarilumab because of exclusion of the largest trial.

Administration of IL-6 antagonists was not associated with an increased risk of 28-day\ninfection compared with usual care or placebo. There was no\nclear association between administration of IL-6 antagonists\nand all-cause mortality at 90 days or in the duration of IMV\namong patients who required IMV at randomization; however, the data were limited.\nAmong the a priori–defined subgroups, the association of\nIL-6 antagonists with improved outcomes appeared more\nmarked among patients who were receiving corticosteroids at\nrandomization compared with those who were not. The association of IL-6 antagonists with lower 28-day all-cause mortality was more marked among patients who did not require\nIMV at randomization, consistent with the inverse association of progression to IMV or death among these patients. However, these differences between subgroups may have arisen due\nto sampling variation. Associations appeared broadly consistent across patient subgroups according to levels of cardiovascular support, C-reactive protein level, age, and sex.\nIn general, associations with improved outcomes were\nmore marked for tocilizumab than for sarilumab, although\ncomparisons between tocilizumab and sarilumab were indirect (made between trials). However, the trials of sarilumab\nwere generally done earlier in the pandemic than those of tocilizumab and before corticosteroids became the standard of\ncare.7 The majority of patients in trials of sarilumab were not\nreceiving corticosteroids at randomization, whereas the majority of patients in trials of tocilizumab were receiving corticosteroids at randomization. When comparisons were made\nwithin groups defined by receipt of corticosteroids at randomization, the differences between associations for these 2 IL-6\nantagonists were less marked. Nearly 3 times as many patients were randomized to trials comparing tocilizumab with\nusual care or placebo compared with trials comparing sarilumab with usual care or placebo. For this reason, associations were estimated more precisely for tocilizumab than for\nsarilumab. Both drugs were IL-6 receptor antagonists, but there\nmay be differences between tocilizumab and sarilumab in receptor binding or lung concentrations.25 Concurrent administration of IL-6 antagonists5 and corticosteroids,26 which both\nhave anti-inflammatory effects, may provide greater improvement than either type of drug given individually.8,9\n\nARTICLE INFORMATION\nAccepted for Publication: June 24, 2021.\nPublished Online: July 6, 2021.\ndoi:10.1001/jama.2021.11330\nThe WHO Rapid Evidence Appraisal for COVID-19\nTherapies (REACT) Working Group authors and\ncollaborators: Manu Shankar-Hari, PhD, MSc; Claire\nL.

Berry, PhD; Niklas Broman, MD;\n\njama.com\n\nOriginal Investigation Research\n\nThis prospective meta-analysis included an estimated 97%\nof patients randomized to IL-6 receptor antagonists vs usual\ncare worldwide. Because data were shared based on standardized definitions of outcomes and subgroups agreed upon in advance, these aggregate data meta-analyses had many of the advantages of individual-patient data meta-analyses while\navoiding the need to establish formal data sharing agreements. The methods used in this meta-analysis limit bias in\nthe selection and appraisal of trials with prespecified subgroup analyses based on clinically relevant questions. For tocilizumab, the results from other trials were similar to those\nfrom the large RECOVERY trial, supporting generalizability of\nthe findings across settings.\n\nLimitations\nThis study has several limitations. First, some of the included\ntrials are ongoing and have not been published in peerreviewed journals. It is possible that lack of participation or participation by some of the ongoing trials may be based on knowledge of their interim results. This limitation was addressed in\nthe sensitivity analyses and the results were consistent with\nthe primary analyses.\nSecond, there were limited data for some comparisons and\nquestions of interest such as IL-6 antagonists vs corticosteroids and the effect of siltuximab. Third, potential differences in treatment effect by differences in the baseline risk of\ndeath (eg, that arose either from trial-specific eligibility criteria, geographic differences, or improving trends in the outcomes of patients with COVID-19 during the pandemic) could\nnot be accounted for.\nFourth, the definitions and reporting of serious adverse\nevents were not consistent across the trials and therefore a\nmeta-analysis for this secondary end point was not conducted. Fifth, larger trials were mainly conducted in highincome settings; 65.9% of the tocilizumab data were provided by participants in the RECOVERY trial9 and 71.0% of the\nsarilumab data were provided by participants in the Regeneron\ntrial (NCT04315298).\n\nConclusions\nIn this prospective meta-analysis of clinical trials of patients\nhospitalized for COVID-19, administration of IL-6 antagonists, compared with usual care or placebo, was associated with\nlower 28-day all-cause mortality.\n\nAlexandre Biasi Cavalcanti, MD; Roos Colman, MSc;\nStefanie L.

In the past decade, we\nobserved a dramatic increase in available software packages for these purposes. As it is increasingly difficult to keep track of the number of available\nimage analysis platforms, tool collections, components and emerging technologies, we provide a conservative overview of software that we use in daily\nroutine and give insights into emerging new tools. We give guidance on which\naspects to consider when choosing the platform that best suits the user’s\nneeds, including aspects such as image data type, skills of the team, infrastructure and community at the institute and availability of time and budget.\nKeywords: bio-image analysis; open-source; software\n\nScientific bio-image analysis software plays a key role\nin modern life sciences [1]. New insights are virtually\nimpossible without computational methods for image\nacquisition, processing, segmentation, feature extraction and visualisation. In the past decade, biologists\nhave increasingly applied statistical data analysis of\nimaging data and machine learning for image processing and particularly for image segmentation, as these\nallow overcoming the limitations of purely descriptive\n\nmethods. We also perceive that tools and methods are\nconverging: if a single software platform provides\nimage processing, feature extraction, statistical analysis\nand visualisation, it is superior and preferred to software that is only good at one of those tasks, at least\nfrom a user’s perspective. Possible applications are\nhighly diverse and spread across multiple subdisciplines such as developmental biology, cancer\nresearch, immunology, cell and molecular biology,\n\nAbbreviations\nANT, advanced normalisation tools; cryoEM, cryo-electron microscopy; CSV, comma-separated values; GUI, graphical user interface; ITK,\nInsight Toolkit; JSON, JavaScript object notation; NEUBIAS, Network or EUropean Bio-Image Analysts; OpenCV, open computer vision;\nRELION, REgularised LIkelihood OptimisatioN; XML, extensible markup language; YAML, yet another markup language.\n\nFEBS Letters (2022) Ó 2022 The Authors.

Often software solutions are created to address a\nparticular analysis challenge in one of those subdisciplines. As it becomes increasingly hard to keep an\noverview of existing software, corresponding key applications and targeted scientific questions, we provide a\ndetailed overview of current state-of-the-art software,\nupcoming next-generation tools and give hints as to\nwhich aspects to consider when deciding among the\nmany available software solutions for current bioimage analysis questions.\nAn early career scientist searching for the right software for their image analysis might have the hardest\ndecision to make. Even if most of them know search\nengines specialised for bio-image analysis software such\nas https://biii.eu or https://bio.tools [2,3], for beginners\nin the field it is hard to make any decisions as they often\ndo not know the right search terms yet. Hence, the glossary provided below may be a good starting point to get\nan overview of available software and related use-cases.\nFurthermore, we recommend attending institutional\nimage-analysis courses, for example, for PhD students\nin their first year. In addition, getting in touch with\nsenior scientists in their own group, with collaborators\nand local light or electron microscopy facilities is a good\nopportunity to find out which software is used in similar\nprojects on campus.\n\nGlossary\nInspired by Adams and Lloyd [4] we give an overview\nof the bio-image analysis software universe by means\nof a glossary of software routinely used by bio-image\nanalysts. To further classify those software-related\nterms, we refer to previously defined groups of software [5]: Firstly, image/data analysis algorithms provided in a sustainably reusable fashion are referred to\nas ‘components’. Secondly, software libraries and standalone applications that combine multiple components\nare ‘collections’. Thirdly, software that combines multiple components, potentially from multiple collections\nto solve a given variety of image analysis questions in\na standardised form are referred to as ‘workflow templates’. If the software is specific for solving particular\nscientific questions using given components in one\nspecific assembly, these are called ‘workflows’. We\nextend this classification with ‘frameworks’ of scientific\nsoftware which are collections upon which many other\nsoftware solutions are built. We add ‘programming\nlanguages’ that allow assembling components into\nworkflows. We furthermore categorise the presented\nsoftware in additional categories such as open-source,\nfree of charge and major application categories such as\n2\n\nR. Haase et al.\n\nacquisition, registration, segmentation and statistical\nanalysis in Table S1. The table also contains properties\nof the listed software such as preferred dimensionality\nof input image data and typical imaging modality. The\nsoftware in the following were selected to reflect longterm available, reliable, sustainably maintained and\nsupported software solutions. We analysts often have\nto have a conservative perspective on existing software\nas we need to rely on established, reliable and maintained software to build workflows for our collaborators and trust the given software to be still available in\n5–10 years allowing reproducible image data analysis.\nTo this end, the number of citations served as a criterion to select software but we also considered software\npackages that have been available for about 5–\n10 years with continuous maintenance and reliable\nsupport by a vivid community. A less formal criterion\nthat we applied for selecting software was considering\nthe knowledge of which tools would have allowed a\nstarting bio-image analyst to follow a conversation at\none of the Network of European Bio-Image Analysts\n(NEUBIAS) meetings. The given description of the\nglossary items highlights the main application of the\nsoftware and its relationships with other glossary\nitems. While the glossary focuses on general software\nand terms used in the field, this should not hide the\nlarge number of software or plugins developed for a\nspecific task or context. In the domain of plant science,\nthe quantitative plant initiative [6] proposes a curated\nlist of software solutions that may also be useful to\nknow. Similarly, in the microscope hardware and control oriented context, a list of useful software was published [7]. Also for lightsheet microscopy, there is a\nspecific list of software for acquisition and analysis\navailable [8].There are a large number of software\ntools and applications that have been specifically\ndeveloped for the cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM);\na comprehensive list of software for the cryoEM community can be found from wikibooks [9].\n3D IMAGEJ SUITE [10] is a collection of IMAGEJ plugins\nfor filtering, segmentation and analysis of geometry,\nshape and spatial organisation of objects in 3D\nimages.\n3D SLICER [11] is an image processing software based\non the ITK library focused on medical imaging with 3D\nsurface extraction, rendering and analysis capabilities.\nIt is increasingly used for visualising and analysing 3D\nstructures such as cells, tissues and organs in microscopy data.\nANTS [12], or Advanced Normalisation Tools, is a\ncollection of methods for image registration, segmentation, and analysis, mostly developed in the context of\nneuro-imaging and the comparison of cohorts.

Haase et al.\n\nand scriptable using advanced scripting languages in\nFIJI such as Groovy, JavaScript and Jython.\nTRAINABLE WEKA SEGMENTATION [82] is a user-friendly\nIMAGEJ plugin for pixel classification using various\nmachine learning techniques based on the Waikato\nEnvironment for Knowledge Analysis [83].\nTRAKEM2 [82,84] is a FIJI plugin for registration,\nstitching and management of large-scale electron\nmicroscopy data which offers tools for segmentation\nand reconstruction of objects such as neurons in 3D.\nZEN (Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany) is a software\nand collection of components for microscope control,\nimage acquisition, visualisation and analysis. Its integration of image analysis and microscope control\nallows feedback microscopy applications.\n\nEmerging software\nApart from our conservative view on the field, we also\nperceive recent software developments which presumably will become part of the above glossary within the\nnext 5–10 years. Most prominently, deep learning\napproaches are flooding our field with promising image\nprocessing components especially for image restoration\n[85-87] and cell/nuclei segmentation [21,76,77,88], classification and tracking [89] within complex scenes. Readers interested in an extended list of new applications and\nready-to-use software [2,3] are referred to [90] and the\nbioimage model zoo online repository [91]. Those deeplearning-based components rely on technical frameworks such as TensorFlow [92] and PyTorch [93] which\nare not directly accessible to end-users. Multiple userfriendly GUIs were recently developed offering modern\ndeep-learning tools to a wide target audience [94-97].\nUser-friendly deep-learning-based image processing is\nalso already integrated within some of the applications\nlisted in the glossary, namely ILASTIK, MICROSCOPY IMAGE\nBROWSER, almost all of the listed commercial software\npackages. New commercial solutions, such as AIVIA\n(Leica Microsystems GmbH) and APEER (Zeiss AG),\nfocusing on machine learning for microscopy image\nanalysis are arising as well.\nIn the same context, the NAPARI project [98] is bridging the PYTHON community towards the life scientists\ncommunity by offering automatically generated, userfriendly GUIs to the most recent deep-learning and\ndata science components and strives to become a\nmajor framework of the bio-image analysis community. From a PYTHON community perspective, napari is\nalready a game changer as it brings widely usable ndimensional viewing to the otherwise scripting centred\nPYTHON community [99]. From a wider perspective,\nmore image visualisation tools have been published\n\nHitchhiking bio-image analysis\n\nrecently and show high potential to become major\nplayers within the next decade since, compared to current default solutions, they provide opportunities to\nprocessing big image data and applying deep learning\nto microscopy image data [100-102].\nProcessing big image data, in the form of large 3D\nimage stacks, long 3D+time data or large collections\nof 2D or 3D image data sets, is also a hot topic where\nnew tools developed using remote-data, remotecomputing and network-based approaches are emerging [103-109] and also semi-commercial solutions are\nappearing such as APEER (Zeiss AG). GraphicsProcessing-Unit (GPU)-accelerated classical image processing [110-113] will play a major role for overcoming\ncurrent limitations concerning processing times for\nlarge image data. From our perspective, such big-data\ncapable solutions will also facilitate analysing spatial\nrelationships in biological specimen and tissues using\nmodern data-science approaches in the context of\nspatial-omics and transcriptomics [114-119].\nFor single molecule localisation microscopy analysis,\nimproved methods for molecule detection and localisation are in active development [120]. In the field of\nsuper-resolution microscopy more broadly, there is\nalso a focus on developing user-friendly methods for\nensuring the fidelity of reconstructed images [121-123].\nLast but not least, new file formats and solutions\nfor research image data management [124-126] are\nunder development and we expect those to have a\nhuge impact on how analysts handle image data within\nthe next decade.\n\nAspects to consider when choosing\nbio-image analysis software for your\nresearch\nThe choice of the right bio-image analysis software is\nclosely related to the purpose of a given research project and more broadly to the field a research group is\nworking in. We suggest becoming confident in a single\nsoftware that broadly fits the planned research needs\ninstead of switching the used software from project to\nproject just because a single feature may be more\naccessible or more accurate in another software. Getting to know software and maintaining expertise comes\nat a high cost when numerous potentially incompatible\nplatforms are used.\nInteroperability between software is another key feature to consider. For example, we discourage using\nsoftware that comes with proprietary custom file formats and suggest using broadly available file formats\ninstead. Most prominently, there are some software\npackages with custom formats for project files. We\n\nFEBS Letters (2022) Ó 2022 The Authors. FEBS Letters published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Federation of European Biochemical Societies.\n\n7\n\n\fHitchhiking bio-image analysis\n\nrecommend making sure these project files can be\naccessed with common text editors and contain\nhuman-readable text that is based on standard formats\nsuch as XML, JSON, YAML or CSV. It also appears\nbeneficial if software has capabilities for workflow\nautomation or, in the case of plugins, can be automated using the platform they can be integrated with.\nFor example, software with a great built-in segmentation algorithm can become a major bottleneck if the\nalgorithm cannot be integrated with other software,\nfor example, for pre-processing, post-processing,\nfeature-extraction and statistical analysis.\nStriving for reproducible bio-image analysis workflows with minimal manual interaction steps is key for\nanalysing large amounts of image data leading to\ninsights cemented by appropriate measurements\nexhibiting statistical power. If the software supports\nforming and properly documenting such automated\nworkflows, reproducibility and interpretability of\nresults can be ensured [127].\nOther technical aspects such as big data capabilities\nplay a key role, especially when new microscopy techniques potentially producing more and more data are\npublished every year. Many software packages claim\nthe ability to work with big data, but often refer to\nvisualisation only or refer to big data as many images\nwith a size of megabytes to gigabytes each. On the\nother hand, software packages capable of processing\nbig volumetric image data in the range of terabytes\nand petabytes to produce quantitative analysis results\nare still rare and often limited in other aspects, for\nexample, image data dimensionality or imaging modality. We see more and more web-based solutions being\npublished diminishing the need to buy expensive computational hardware, to train and execute neural network architectures. When using web-based solutions in\nthe cloud, institutional, national and international laws\nhave to be respected. Additional technical burdens hinder the wide adoption of cloud computing at the\nmoment. For example, uploading multiple terabytes of\nimaging data from a European institute to an American computing server is not just challenging from a\nlegal but also from the file transfer bandwidth perspective. We assume these burdens will fall in the next decade and the technology will become available to more\nand more researchers as the benefits of using it outweigh the risks. Hence, choosing a software that is\ninteroperable with cloud-computing and cloud-storage\ntechnologies appears a future-proof approach.\nMany image analysis tasks have a substantial number of solutions that have been developed, and it can\noften be unclear which solution is most appropriate\nfor a user’s specific problem. Several image analysis\n8\n\nR. Haase et al.\n\nfields have established benchmarking challenges,\nwhereby software is applied to exemplar datasets and\nperformance is automatically and independently\nassessed. Such challenges exist for cell tracking\n[128,129], cell segmentation [130], electron microscopy\nimage segmentation [131] and single molecule localisation [120]. These provide users with a quantitative\ncomparison of the state-of-the-art, along with test\ndatasets and guidance for quality reporting.\nCommunity aspects should also be taken into\naccount when choosing the right image analysis software. A key role in bio-image analysis for microscopy\nis played by the Image Science community https://\nimage.sc, an online forum where developers and users\nof most software listed in the glossary are actively supporting each other by providing support and feedback\n(Fig. 1). Before using a software mid /long-term,\nusers may want to explore this forum and other online\nplatforms to figure out how actively supported the\nsoftware is by a broader community. Furthermore,\nsome software communities hold regular virtual community meetings, where users and plugin-developers\ncan get in touch with core-developers to exchange\nideas, use-cases and receive support. The weekly community meeting of the napari community and the open\noffice hours of the CellProfiler community shall be\nhighlighted here as well-appreciated examples. For\nstaying up-to-date with new developments in bioimage analysis software, following new media channels\nsuch as the NEUBIAS Academy YouTube channel\n[132] and the @Talk_BioImg Twitter bot which\nretweets posts containing the #BioImageAnalysis hashtag should be considered as well for an audience with\ngeneral interest in the field, for example, postdocs and\ncore-facility staff working on applied bio-image analysis and image data science. In addition, the Global\nBioimaging infrastructure is organising image analysis\ncourses and providing a training resource for core\nfacility staff and image analysis community.\nFrom a group leader’s and an institutional decision\nmaker’s perspective, guiding scientists towards using a\ncommon software platform makes sense. The more\nlocal collaborators work with the same software, and\nmaybe just use different plugins, the more they can\nsupport each other and exchange knowledge. If it is\napparent that a majority of the group or institute\nmembers are using the same software, an institute can\nstrengthen this community by inviting the developers\nof that software annually for courses and seminars.\nBuilding this bridge between users and developers is of\nmutual benefit: While the users receive support and\ntraining from the experts, the experts can establish collaborations with power users leading to scientific\n\nFEBS Letters (2022) Ó 2022 The Authors. FEBS Letters published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Federation of European Biochemical Societies.\n\n\fR. Haase et al.\n\npublications. These applied-science publications are\nkey to grant applications and sustainable maintenance\nof research software.\n\nConclusions and perspectives\nComparing the bio-image analysis software universe\none decade ago to its current state clearly shows that\nit is expanding. Multiple huge ecosystems grew from a\nsmall number of general-purpose software developed\nmore than a decade ago. Recently, many of such platforms are building bridges among them, which is\nappreciated from our bio-image analysis workflow\ndesigners’ perspective. Hence, users are well advised to\nuse interoperable, established, sustainably maintained\nsoftware packages for their research. It is also important to stay alert on recent developments, especially in\nthe deep learning context, even though one should stay\na brave scientist and question those new methods.\nSuch critical thinking is necessary to solidify knowledge about new methods before eventually adopting\nthem as community standards. Last but not least we\nwant to emphasise that the decision on which software\nto use for specific research projects should be made in\ngroups. Getting in touch with local, regional and global experts and discussing advantages and disadvantages is the right path in a growing universe of bioimage analysis software.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Mafalda Sousa (I3S, Porto),\nIgnacio Arganda-Carreras (Universidad del Pais\nVasco, Donostia-San Sebastian), Martin Jones (The\nFrancis Crick Institute, London) for reviewing the\nmanuscript and providing constructive feedback prior\nto submission.
