# ws-transli-tal@1.0.0

TransliTAL is a suite of tools for producing and correcting romanizations for
library records.  
We offer a rules-based transliteration system based on the ISO norms for
romanizing the Cyrillic alphabet, and finetuned language models for romanizing
more ambiguous writing systems for languages like Arabic and Japanese.

TransliTAL is the fruit of a joint research project between the *Bibliothèque
universitaire des langues et civilisations* (BULAC) and the *Institut national des
langues et civilisations orientales* (INALCO). Our work was made possible by
financing from the *Agence bibliographique de l'enseignement supérieur* (ABES).

It's a first collaboration with [Inist-CNRS](https://www.inist.fr/) to create a
web service.  
This server is still a work in progress, not all endpoints are available yet.
