        "description": "TransliTAL is a suite of tools for producing and correcting romanizations for library records. We offer a rules-based transliteration system based on the ISO norms for romanizing the Cyrillic alphabet, and finetuned language models for romanizing more ambiguous writing systems for languages like Arabic and Japanese.\n\nTransliTAL is the fruit of a joint research project between the *Bibliothèque universitaire des langues et civilisations* (BULAC) and the *Institut national des langues et civilisations orientales* (INALCO). Our work was made possible by financing from the *Agence bibliographique de l'enseignement supérieur* (ABES).\n\nYou may consult [the official project webpage](https://www.bulac.fr/translital).",
