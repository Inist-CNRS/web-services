Web services at Inist-CNRS

This repository is a work in progress.

It will host the re-implemented web services that are currently at [Inist's
GitBucket](https://gitbucket.inist.fr/tdm/web-services), but using only Docker
images (inspired from
[ezmaster-apps](https://github.com/Inist-CNRS/ezmaster-apps), except that images
won't be as versatile: they won't install npm packages depending on their
`config.json`, nor pip packages depending on their `requirements.txt` at launch,
all installs should be done at image building).
